# The base framework of the API -> Hono

> Hono - means flame🔥 in Japanese - is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.

# Guidelines

The proyect is structured following the guidelines of Hono, but we also have our own conventions and structures to follow.

## Architecture

In src/ we have the following folders:

- db/: contains the database schema and related files from drizzle.
- routes/: contains all the routes of the API, structured by groups of related endpoints.
- services/: contains the business logic of the application, separated from the routes. For example, connecting to RabbitMQ. Business logic that can be reused across different routes should go here.
- utils/: contains utility functions and helpers that can be used throughout the application. Now contains helpers for creating sub routers (used in each group of routes), and types definitions.
- middleware/: contains custom middleware functions that can be applied to routes or the entire application. For example, authentication middleware, logging middleware, error handling middleware, etc.
  index.ts: is the main entry point of the application, where the Hono app is created, middleware is applied, and routes are registered.

## Routes

A route shoud be part of a group of related endpoints. Each group should have its own index file in the routes/ folder. For example, all user-related endpoints should be in routes/user.index.ts.
If the group of routes is big enough, you can create a folder for it inside routes/, and split the endpoints into multiple files. For example, routes/user/create.ts, routes/user/delete.ts, etc.
Each route file should export a Hono Router instance created via createRouter(), which will be imported and registered in src/index.ts via publicRoutes or privateRoutes list in that file.
The "route_group".index.ts of the route group should be the combination of "route_group".routes.ts with "route_group".handlers.ts. Basically, the routes file should only contain the route definitions and the handlers file should contain the actual implementation of the handlers and in "route_group".index.ts you should import both and combine them to export a single Router instance.

## DB

The database schema should be defined using Drizzle ORM in the db/ folder. Each table should have its own file, and related tables can be grouped into subfolders if necessary. Use as much of Drizzle's features as possible to ensure type safety and ease of use.
